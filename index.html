            <p>Football (or soccer as the game is called in some parts of the world) has a long history. Football in its current form arose in England in the middle of the 19th century. But alternative versions of the game existed much earlier and are a part of the football history.<br /><br />Football was for a long time a British phenomenon, but it gradually spread to other European countries. The first game that took place outside Europe occurred in Argentina in 1867, but it was foreign British workers who were involved and not Argentinean citizens.<br><br>Soccer began to evolve in modern Europe from the medieval period onwards. The game was often seen as a nuisance and was even banned during some periods of Britainâ€™s history.<br><br>Soccer is a sport played between two teams of eleven players with a ball and is known as football in most countries outside of Australia and the United States. It is played by 250 million players in over 200 countries, making it the world's most popular sport.

            <p>My favourite game is soccer because it entertains you and it is fun. Soccer involves many skills and is played by people 4-50.It encourages teamwork and relationships. Personally, I love soccer because it is time-consuming and get to see my friends.<br>Also, I also like it because it is always in the morning. If you are confused, cool it down and listen;I go to soccer training on Saturdays in the morning, 10:30am to 11:45am.<br><br>My other favourite thing to do is coding! Coding is awesome and you can create your own application such as games and info apps. I code on WhiteHatJr, an oline platform which teaches you how to code. Join today or visit the website. I dream to become a cool coder and create my own applications.<br>You can watch the video underneath to learn some basic soccer drills.</p>

            <p>I have gotten a lot of trophies and certificates in soccer training and all of them have been great. I have been doing soccer for 3 years now so it is not a surprise that I know a lot of stuff including soccer or foot-based techniques. I have gotten 11 certificates and 3 trophies so far. Each year's trophies are different but the certificates stay the same. I still do soccer and I just got another trophy 1 and a half week ago.I have been interested in the trophies and keep them somewhere where nobody can get their hands on them.The trophies look somewhat like this.I have gotten some that look like these.

            <p>My inspiration came from the number #1 soccer player, Cristiano Ronaldo. He is the best and my favourite soccer player. After I watched a video about him I started thinking and I said "Maybe I should do soccer so I can be like him!" So I took inspiration, told my mum and dad about it and they signed me up. I was very excited and soon got into the soccer lifestyle. My parents are the best and they pay $143 every term but they do not mind because they know it is good for me. I also think about soccer every single day, thinking about skills that could make me better at this awesome and fun sport. Soccer rules and it is the best!!!</p>
